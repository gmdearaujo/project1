    <string name="how_to_play_text">  \n Winning:\n\n
       
       The first player to 500 points wins. Points are awarded based on the time remaining on the clock.\n\n
        
        Gameplay:\n\n
        
        Player 1 always draws first.\n\n 
        
        The drawing player creates a drawing in the given category. Once they are finished, they press \'Done\' and supply the name of the drawing as well as 
        a hint for the other player. These must be entered for play to continue. Once this is complete, press \'Ok\' and pass to the guessing player.\n\n
        
        The guessing player has 2:20 to guess the correct answer. After 1:10, the previously entered hint appears. If the guessing player fails to correctly 
        guess the answer in the allotted time, no points are awarded. After time expires or the player guesses correctly, it is now their turn to draw.\n\n
